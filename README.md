Employed Python and data analysis tools to assess a sizable dataset covering customer behavior, personal info, transactions, credit scores, aiming to ascertain customer retention rates and devise churn-reduction tactics for an undisclosed firm.

Customer Retention Analysis and Churn Reduction Report
Project Overview

Project Title: Customer Retention Analysis and Churn Reduction for Unnamed Company
Project Duration: Summer of 2023
Project Scope: Analyzing customer behavior, personal details, bank transactions, and credit scores to determine the customer retention rate and propose solutions for churn reduction.
Introduction

In this report, I present the findings and recommendations from my data analysis project aimed at assisting the unnamed company in understanding and improving customer retention. This project involved working with a large dataset encompassing various aspects of customer interactions and profiles.

Data Preprocessing

To ensure data quality and consistency, I performed comprehensive data preprocessing, including:

Handling missing values.
Detecting and addressing outliers.
Standardizing and transforming data where necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

My EDA revealed valuable insights into customer behavior and churn factors:

Visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, were used to explore data distribution and correlations.
Key findings included the identification of trends, seasonality, and customer segments.
Feature Importance Analysis

To prioritize actionable strategies, I determined the most influential factors contributing to churn. This analysis guided my recommendations.

Recommendations

Based on my analysis, I propose the following strategies to reduce churn:

Personalized Marketing Campaigns: Leverage customer segmentation to tailor marketing efforts and incentives, targeting at-risk customers with special offers and promotions.

Improved Customer Support: Enhance customer support by reducing response times and addressing issues proactively. Implement a customer feedback loop for continuous improvement.

Product Enhancements: Invest in product development based on customer feedback and preferences. Ensure that the product aligns with customer needs and expectations.

Customer Retention Rate Calculation

I calculated the customer retention rate before and after implementing my recommended solutions to measure the impact of my project.

Conclusion

My data analysis project successfully identified key factors contributing to churn and provided actionable recommendations to improve customer retention. By implementing these strategies, the unnamed company can work towards reducing churn and increasing customer satisfaction.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, Python, and data preprocessing techniques, highlighting my ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and drive data-driven decision-making.
